* λℵ v0.0.10
  
  λℵ\star is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot from the
  ground up, using only CHICKEN Scheme, by someone who hasn't done any network
  programming before and isn't good at Scheme.

** Dependencies
*** Connection
- =http-client=
- =openssl=
- =uri-common=
- =websockets=

*** Parsing
- =args=
- =medea=

** Building
   =csc main.scm -o λℵ= but...
   The binary only has arguments for printing the version/copyright
   string and the help message.
   Currently there's no interface for the procedures built into it
   until I figure out a good way to do so. You can run it with
   =csi main.scm= and manually call the procedures instead.
** Notes
   *\star :* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the
   fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
