* λℵ v0.0.9
  
  λℵ\star is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot from the
  ground up, using only CHICKEN Scheme, by someone who hasn't done any network
  programming before and isn't good at Scheme.

** Dependencies
*** Connection
- =http-client=
- =openssl=
- =uri-common=
- =websockets=

*** Parsing
- =args=
- =medea=

** Notes
   *\star :* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the
   fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
