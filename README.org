* λℵ v0.0.2
  
  λℵ is an initial attempt at writing a simple Discord bot using only Scheme (probably with minimal C FFI in the future for OAuth 2.0).

  It's a work-in-progress. As of now, it does nothing but =POST= JSON with =content= text to webhooks and probably even fails at that.

  Requires the following eggs:
- =http-client=
- =intarweb=
- =medea=
- =openssl=
- =uri-common=
