* λℵ v0.0.2
  
  λℵ is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot using only Scheme (probably with minimal C FFI in the future for OAuth 2.0) by someone who isn't good at Scheme.

  It's obviously a work-in-progress. As of now, it does nothing but =POST= JSON with =content= text to webhooks and probably even fails at that.

** Required eggs
- =http-client=
- =intarweb=
- =medea=
- =openssl=
- =uri-common=

*PS:* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
