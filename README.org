* λℵ v0.0.3
  
  λℵ is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot using only CHICKEN Scheme (probably with minimal C FFI in the future for OAuth 2.0) by someone who isn't good at Scheme.

  It's obviously a work-in-progress. As of now, it does nothing but =POST= JSON with =content= text to webhooks and probably even fails at that.

** Required eggs
- =http-client= (for HTTP requests)
- =intarweb= (for =http-client= to work)
- =medea= (to interpret JSON files)
- =openssl= (to use HTTPS)
- =system= (to build the project)
- =uri-common= (to evaluate URIs)

*PS:* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
