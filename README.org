* λℵ v0.1.6
  
  λℵ\star is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot from the
  ground up, using CHICKEN Scheme.

  Currently only implements a portion of the REST API.

** Notes
   *\star :* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the
   fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
