* λℵ v0.0.5
  
  λℵ\star is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot using only
  CHICKEN Scheme by someone who isn't good at Scheme.

** Dependencies
*** Connection
- =http-client=
- =openssl=
- =uri-common=

*** Parsing
- =args=
- =medea=

*** Building
- =system=

** Notes
   I can't be arsed to implement websockets and OAuth 2.0 functionality for now.
   You'll need to connect to the gateway at least once with [[https://discordapi.com/unofficial/libs.html][some other library]]
   at least once before you use the bot. Or use any websocket library of your choice.
   I used [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-websocket-client/][this]]. The rest is just =PUT=, =POST=, =PATCH= and =GET= on the REST API.
   
   *\star :* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the
   fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
