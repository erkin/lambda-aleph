* λℵ v0.0.3
  
  λℵ\star is a half-arsed attempt at writing a simple Discord bot using only CHICKEN Scheme (probably with minimal C FFI in the future for OAuth 2.0) by someone who isn't good at Scheme.

  It's obviously a work-in-progress. As of now, it does nothing but =POST= JSON with =content= text to webhooks and probably even fails at that.

** Dependencies
*** Connection
- =http-client=
  - =intarweb=
  - =openssl=
- =uri-common=

*** Parsing
- =medea=

*** Building
- =system=

** Notes
   *\star :* We could've used =\lambda\aleph= in this file if it weren't for the fact that GitHub's markup engine doesn't render some org-mode special symbols.
